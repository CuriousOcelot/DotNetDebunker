## üìå Context

When analyzing .NET malware samples, you may find that method bodies are missing during static analysis. This is because
such samples often load their IL code dynamically at runtime, rendering tools like `dnspy` is ineffective.

Traditional methods such as JIT hooking (intercepting `compileMethod` and `getEHinfo`) can help, but many malware
samples behave differently or fail to run properly when runtime binaries are modified via trampoline hooks.

To work around this, **WinDbg** can be used to **debug** and **dump the necessary memory**, allowing to capture the
arguments and results of these functions **without modifying the process**.

## ü§î Why Python?

Most .NET reverse engineering tools are written in C# and are part of old or complex Visual Studio projects. Compiling them is difficult, and Visual Studio is bloated for small tasks.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è Python ‚Äî it's lightweight, easy to use. So, this tool was written in Python for simplicity.

## üìã Features

- Capture arguments passed to `CILJit::compileMethod` and the result of `IMethodInfo::getEhInfo` using WinDbg.
- Edit packed `.exe` or `.dll` using the captured IL code and metadata.
- Optional section injection or in-place IL replacement.
- Fully scriptable and customizable.

## üß† Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Capture IL Code

Use WinDbg to attach to the target .NET process and log the parameters and results of key JIT functions.

‚û°Ô∏è **Read `WINDBG_STEP.md`** for step-by-step instructions.

### Step 2: Modify Executable

Once the IL and metadata are captured, use the Python script to:

- Patch existing IL methods
- Or inject new sections (if needed)

---

## üß™ Quick Testing

To test the full process, run:

```bat
.\setup.bat
.\test_unpack.bat
```

This will:

- Use `testprog_packed.exe` from `.\rsc\jit_hook_test_binary\test_packed_binary\`
- Unpack it in a bytearray
- Verify the checksum matches the known unpacked binary in:
    - `test_unpacked_binary`
    - `newsec_test_unpacked_binary`

Or manually run:

```bat
.\main_dotnet_editor.bat
```

This will unpack:

```plaintext
.\rsc\jit_hook_test_binary\test_packed_binary\testprog_packed.exe
```

to:

```plaintext
~\Downloads\testprog_unpacked.exe
```

using the debug data from:

```plaintext
.\rsc\jit_hook_test_binary\windebug_output\
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Usage

```bash
(.venv) > python ./main_dotnet_editor.py -i "input_path" -o "output_path" -w "windebug_output_path" -f "folder_name_in_windebug_output_path" -ns -a
```
## Command Line Arguments

The tool supports the following command line options:

| Argument                     | Description                          | Type  | Default                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
| `-i`, `--input`              | Input file path                      | `str` | *testprog_packed.exe*   |
| `-o`, `--output`             | Output file path                     | `str` | *testprog_unpacked.exe* |
| `-w`, `--windebug`           | WinDbg output file path              | `str` | *windbg_output*         |
| `-f`, `--folder_name`        | Subfolder name in WinDbg output path | `str` | *testprog_packed*       |
| `-y`, `--yes`                | Skip prompt (assume yes)             | Flag  | `False`                 |
| `-t`, `--testmode`           | Enable test mode                     | Flag  | `False`                 |
| `-ns`, `--new_section`       | Force adding a new section           | Flag  | `False`                 |
| `-a`, `--new_sec_autosizing` | Enable auto-sizing of new section    | Flag  | `False`                 |

### Options

- `-ns`: Forces the addition of a new section instead of replacing the IL code.  
  _Note: It's generally better to add a new section rather than replace the existing IL bytes.

- `-a` : Adjust output file size to match the input file.  
  _Prevents size overflows when editing binary content._

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- WinDbg (for initial data capture)
